## About the project

Our demo app is a sleek showcase of how easy and intuitive it can be to interact with blockchain technology. We've built it using React.js, creating a simple yet effective user interface. The process starts with a user-friendly form. Once you submit it, a third-party service quickly checks your data. If everything looks good, you get a reward in the form of tokens.

We chose the Sepolia network. Our app connects to the GHO contract and uses its transfer function for transactions. We've simplified things by extracting the private key on the admin account that already has tokens, so users receive their rewards promptly after submitting their data.

In short, our app is all about demonstrating a smooth and user-friendly way to transfer tokens, combining modern web technologies with smart blockchain interactions. It's designed to be easy to understand and use, even for those new to blockchain.
